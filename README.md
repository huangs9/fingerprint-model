# Lipophilicity Model Training

This repository contains a script to train a regression model on the Lipophilicity dataset. The model uses Morgan fingerprints and MACCS keys to predict the lipophilicity of compounds. Lipophilicity is a key property in medicinal chemistry and drug development.

## Contents

This repository includes the 'Lipophilicity.csv' dataset in 'data' folder, 'train_model.py' in 'scripts' folder, 'results.txt' which is generated by running the script and 'environment.yml' which is an environment file that can be used to create a new conda environment capable of running the 'train_model.py' scripts.

## Requirements

Before running the script, you need to set up the environment. Use the provided `environment.yml` file to create a conda environment with all the necessary dependencies:

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/huangs9/lipophilicity_model
   cd lipophilicity_model

2. **Create the Conda Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml

## Usage

Navigate to the `scripts/` directory and run the following command:

```bash
cd scripts/
conda activate lipophilicity_model
python train_model.py --hidden_layers 100 50 --max_iter 1000
